# Introduction

> Prexty is a experimental feature.

## What is Prexty?

Prexty is a plugin for [prext](/) that makes it possible to use a frontend language.

For example, if you want to make own blog with react, you can use prexty enjoying the advantages of [prext](/).

## Why you made it?

No reason. But other frameworks ([next.js](https://nextjs.org), [nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/)) are very awesome but they are so big to make simple website.

As we said in the [introduction](/guide/what-is-prext), our goal is lightness and speed.

If it sounds good, read the [installation guide](/prexty/installation) and make a awesome website.
